# Trump Commit

Trump Commit is a global npm module that lets you commit code with a Trump-style message. Simply run the `trump-commit` command and it will generate a random message from a list of predefined messages and commit your code with that message.

## Installation

To install Trump Commit, run the following command:



```bash 
npm install -g trump-commit
```

This will install the Trump Commit module globally, making it available from anywhere in your terminal.

## Usage

To use Trump Commit, navigate to the directory containing the code you want to commit and run the following command:



```bash 
trump-commit 
```
This will generate a random message from a list of predefined messages and commit your code with that message.

You can also specify a custom message using the `-m` or `--message` option:



``` bash
trump-commit -m "Make code great again!"
```
